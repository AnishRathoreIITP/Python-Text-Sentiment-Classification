# Real-Time Sentiment Classifier

## Project Goal
Developed a foundational Machine Learning model to classify text (e.g., reviews or social media comments) into positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. This project demonstrates core skills in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and model construction.

## Technologies Used
* **Python:** Primary programming language.
* **Scikit-learn:** Used for training and implementing the text classification model.
* **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** Essential for text cleaning, tokenization, and stop-word removal.
* **Pandas:** Used for loading and preparing the text dataset.

## Outcomes
* Successfully applied the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model to transform text into numerical features suitable for machine learning.
* The model achieved a competitive classification accuracy of [Insert a number, e.g., 78%] on the test dataset.# Python-Text-Sentiment-Classification
Sentiment analysis model built using Scikit-learn and NLTK for text classification.
